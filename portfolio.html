						<h1>Drone Championship League - The Game</h1>
						<img src="images/Banner_DCL.jpg">
						<p>This game that is published by THQ utilises UE4 C++; it is a sport-style game involving drones where you race against other 
						players to achieve the fastest time.</p>
						
						<p>Within this project I assisted in fixing outstanding errors within specific builds and debbuging issues on specific builds of the game not working. 
						Implemented the usage of an analytics website, Utilising JSON payloads to push information to a REST API to be used for further information
						of specific events. I also worked on optimising the code to provide a better performance.</p>

						<h1>Celestial Dash (Mobile Game Work In Progress)</h1>
						<img src="images/Banner_CelestialDash.jpg">
						<p>This project is where you play as a comet, on a long journey, exploring the unknown of the Universe.
						Throughout the journey many asteroid belts, planets and unknown entities of the universe will attempt
						to put this journey to a halt. This started as a University project, in which I put my skills to the 
						test for mobile development.</p>
						
						<p>This game was ran on the Unity Game Engine, utilising the Google Play API, this in mind had achievements implemented
						which would unlock new skins for the player as they unlock more achievements. The Universal Render Pipeline was used to
						produce some amazing shaders for the skins and planets all around.</p>

						<p>This is a project that I am at the moment remaking, into an app that can be played from the Android App
						store, this remake is aimed at ensuring the gameplay feels more arcade-like and has further features aside
						leaderboards, skins and achievements.</p>

					<section id="VR">
						<h1>Virtual Reality Fitness Project</h1>
						<img src="images/Banner_VR.jpg">
						<p>In this project you can record your own dance or exercise routines, or check out other peoples
						recordings that they did. Giving you an idea on how to perform the dance moves or what to do
						whilst you are performing that exercise!</p>
						
						<p>The game utilised the SteamVR(Also known as OpenVR) API, in which I used an observer pattern to record the users hand
						and head positions, in which they were saved to a XML file, you can then play back the file by
						interacting with the board in the game. This will play back the positions saved on the file, lerping
						each position.</p>
						
						<p>A project I enjoyed working on considering it was only a University project. One that I
						would like to revisit in the future!</p>
					</section>

				<!-- Three -->
					<section id="OClock">
						<h1>O'Clock</h1>
						<img src="images/Banner_OClock.jpg">
						<p>This game takes you to a Mansion, within the Mansion there is a lot of trickery going on,
						having to solve many puzzles in an escape-room style game. These puzzles involve time itself,
						needing a tool to change the position in time itself to unlock the doors to solve this unusual
						mystery that has been bestowed upon you.</p>
						<p>The game was a test in more of game design rather than gameplay, requiring decisive ideas to
						shape the gameplay on the puzzles. This game utilised an inventory system that involved crafting,
						requiring certain objects to be inspected within the inventory. Time travelling will allow
						the player to take objects across both periods.</p>
						
						<p>This project was produced with one other person for a University project, this project challenged
						us to ensure coordination was in play and that we were reaching targets, utilising Trello and the
						MoSCoW principle to prioritise tasks!
					</section>
					
					<section id="SDL">
						<h1>Mario Bros SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer)</h1>
						<img src="images/Banner_SDL.jpg">
						<p>This game was a recreation of the original Mario Bros, focusing on ensuring all of the gameplay
						from the game are accurate, including scores, UI, core gameplay and two-player, which used the same
						keyboard.</p>
						<p>Recreating this game utilised the Library SDL, this was a University project that I had a lot of passion for,
						teaching me a lot in programming for scene- based switching and how animations work, giving further 
						knowledge into C++ and the fundamentals to core rendering engine functionality.</p> 
						
						<p>This project was possibly my favourite during first year and I had a lot of fun producing it, would
						love to try and make a recreation of another infamous title to test myself!</p>
						
						<b>I do not own any assets used within the project, involving sprites/images, concept and audio.</b>

					<section id="HorrorGame">
						<h1>Unity Horror Game</h1>
						<img src="images/Banner_SpookyGame.jpg">
						<p>Within this project you wake up in a street, confused on what is happening, there is a tingling
						feeling something is watching you. Use the tools provided to you to determine what is happening,
						and what could be out there...</p>
						
						<p>The project was a University project, testing the different features the Unity Engine had to
						offer, involving developing a shader to give a portal-style visual. Utilising render layers
						and different Camera tricks, showing the enemy that was hidden, this enemy interferes with
						lamps and different objects around.</p>
						
						<p>Through the development of this project I also tested myself in asset production, despite
						not looking the best, it at least does resemble the gameplay elements that were needed.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section id="AssetPack">
						<h1>Unreal Engine 4 Combat Asset Pack</h1>
						<img src="images/Banner_UE4AssetPack.jpg">
						<p>This project was different to my other projects that I have developed, this one focusing
						instead on an asset pack that can be used by game designers. The intention behind this project
						was to implement sword-based combat, this involved an attack, block and parry.</p>
						
						<p>Using C++ I managed to produce the combat system, ensuring the player becomes still
						when performing the sword swing, with the usage of AnimNotifies and custom delegates. This
						encouraged me to test myself, making a project that can be used in your average gameplay.</p>
						
						<p>This was a University project, one that I would love to develop further and ensure the
						gameplay is fluent to be usable as an asset.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section id="ShooterGame">
						<h1>Unreal Engine 4 Shooter Game</h1>
						<img src="images/Banner_UE4ShooterGame.jpg">
						<p>Within this game it was a project to help introduce myself to UE4 C++, however ended up
						producing a playable prototype, despite this being an assignment for University, I did have
						a lot of fun working on this, giving me a stronger understanding of how to utilise the core
						elements of the engine.</p>
						
						<p>During this I understood more on animation, AI movement and programming techniques such
						as Object Pooling, in which produced a projectile system, utilising the Kismatic library and
						delegates within the game. Producing events on when a projectile should despawn for example.
						I also explored into linking C++ to Blueprint and applying that to the UI(User Interface),
						such as when a player takes damage or when the player gets to the end of the level.</p>
